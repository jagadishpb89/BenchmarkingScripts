nodes: 400
max pods that can be safely deployed: 7600

1. Apply labelA on 200 nodes(setA)
2. Apply labelB on 200 nodes(setB)
3. Deploy 1000 normal pods with labelC on setA nodes using nodeSelector.
4. Deploy 1000 pod affinty pods which has affinity on 1000 normal pods which has labelC.
5. Only measure scheduling time taken by pod affinity pods.
